# EarthViewer
Simple iOS app that replicates the behavior of http://earthview.withgoogle.com and the Earth View [Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/earth-view-from-google-ea/bhloflhklmhfpedakmangadcdofhnnoh). Since the website is no longer active this provides a nice way to still browse the images.

Resource list provided by: https://github.com/alexpersian/earthview

### App Behavior
* On app start a random image will be selected. There are 2604 different images.
* Tapping on the right side of the screen advances to the next image. Tapping on the left side goes to previous image.
* Tapping on the info box will navigate to the image's location in Google Maps.
* Tapping on the save image icon will save the currently displayed image (in full-res) to your camera roll. This requires giving image save permissions to the app.
